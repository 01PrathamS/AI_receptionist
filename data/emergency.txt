Heart Attack: If someone experiences chest pain, shortness of breath, or discomfort that radiates to the arms or jaw, it could be a heart attack. Call emergency services immediately and keep the person calm. Help them sit in a comfortable position, preferably with their back supported and knees bent. If they are conscious and not allergic, give them aspirin to chew. Monitor their condition until help arrives.

Severe Bleeding: For severe bleeding, apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage to control the blood flow. If possible, elevate the injured area above the heart. Keep applying pressure until emergency services arrive. Do not remove any embedded objects, as this can worsen the bleeding. If the person becomes unresponsive, be prepared to start CPR if necessary.

Choking: If someone is choking and unable to breathe or speak, perform the Heimlich maneuver. Stand behind the person, wrap your arms around their waist, and give sharp upward thrusts just above the belly button. Repeat until the object is expelled. If the person becomes unresponsive, begin CPR and call emergency services.

Stroke: If someone shows signs of a stroke—such as sudden weakness on one side of the body, slurred speech, or confusion—act FAST. FAST stands for Face (check for drooping), Arms (see if they can lift both arms), Speech (listen for slurred speech), and Time (call emergency services immediately). Keep the person calm and monitor them while awaiting medical help.

Severe Allergic Reaction (Anaphylaxis): Symptoms of anaphylaxis include difficulty breathing, swelling, and hives. If the person has an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen), help them use it immediately. Call emergency services even if symptoms improve. Keep the person lying down with their legs elevated while waiting for help, and monitor their breathing and pulse.

Burns: For first-degree burns, run cool (not cold) water over the area for 10-15 minutes, and then apply a clean, non-stick dressing. For second- or third-degree burns (with blisters or charred skin), avoid using water and do not apply creams or ointments. Cover the burn with a clean, loose cloth and seek medical attention immediately. Keep the person calm and hydrated while awaiting emergency services.

Poisoning: If someone has ingested poison or harmful substances, do not induce vomiting unless advised by a medical professional. Call the poison control center or emergency services right away. Try to identify the substance ingested, and provide this information to the responders. Keep the person calm and avoid giving them food or drink unless instructed by a healthcare provider.

Seizures: If someone is having a seizure, do not restrain them. Instead, clear the area of any objects that could cause injury. Place something soft under their head, and turn them onto their side to help keep their airway clear. Do not put anything in their mouth. Time the seizure, and if it lasts longer than five minutes or if it’s the person’s first seizure, call emergency services. Stay with them until the seizure subsides.

Drowning: If someone is drowning, try to reach them with a long object or throw them a flotation device. If you need to enter the water, approach from behind to avoid being grabbed by the victim in panic. Once they’re out of the water, if they’re unresponsive and not breathing, start CPR immediately and call emergency services. Continue CPR until professional help arrives.

Electric Shock: If someone has been electrocuted, do not touch them directly, as you could also become electrocuted. Turn off the power source if possible, or use a non-conductive object, such as a wooden stick, to separate them from the source. Once they are free, check their breathing and pulse. If they are unresponsive, start CPR and call emergency services. Monitor them closely until help arrives, as electrical injuries can have delayed effects.
